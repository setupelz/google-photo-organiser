# Implementation Plan

**Generated:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** No active work

---

## Current State

All specifications are marked as `✅ Implemented`:
- `specs/setup-photo-organiser.md` — Complete

All implementation tasks have been completed. The photo organiser tool is fully functional with:
- Core processing logic (zip extraction, metadata reading, file organization)
- CLI interface with progress reporting
- Comprehensive test suite (all tests passing)
- Error handling and logging
- Build infrastructure for Windows executable
- Complete documentation (README, build docs, inline documentation)

---

## Remaining Work

**Manual Testing Required:**
- Windows 10/11 executable testing (requires Windows system, not automatable)

This is a manual verification step that cannot be performed in the macOS development environment. The build infrastructure is complete and verified. All core functionality has been validated via unit tests.

---

## No Active Planning Tasks

All development work is complete. The implementation plan is empty because there are no specs marked `🚧 In Progress` or `📋 Planned`.

To add new work:
1. Create a new spec in `specs/` with status `📋 Planned` or `🚧 In Progress`
2. Re-run planning mode to generate tasks

## Summary

✅ All implementation complete
✅ All tests passing
✅ Build infrastructure ready
✅ Documentation complete
⏸️ Windows manual testing pending (requires Windows 10/11 system)
